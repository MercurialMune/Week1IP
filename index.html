          <p><em>Cyprian Munene</em> is just a cool guy with a love for all things artsy and techy. At heart, I am an artist. However, my personality predisposes me to have an insatiable hunger for learning all things technology. I love Science, especially deep "universe stuff" and emerging tech. I also love psychology and is a favorite past-time for me.My interests in those aspects can be summarized as follows;</p>
